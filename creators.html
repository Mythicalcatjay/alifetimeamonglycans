I am the one who does all of the art, writes the descriptions, reaches out to people, writes scripts, does a portion of the subtitles, coded a lot of the website, and owns the youtube channel. I think of my work ethic as something akin to a German Shepherd on crack and I steal shit from Jojo to get things done on my more evil self inflicted deadlines. (Bad Habit)</td>
        <td>Howdy! I am the local editor and I typically help with scripts and sheets as well as any of the smaller tasks around here though I am the main man when it comes to the IT, video and audio editing, I am nowhere near as impressive with my speed compared to Kirke but I dedicated to ensuring that all goes well! </td>
