    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Q: Is Gena a girl?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1108831294911152212/1124422101818949692/image.png" style="color: #769ABB;text-decoration: none;">Kirke's A: Not quiet, and any confusion wasn't on purpose. That's just what happens when you combine historical accuracy and androgyny.</a></p>
    <p>Jojo's A: Nope! He is our beloved little twink although in the design phase we definitely intended for it to confuse people.</p>
    <p>Vita’s A: One of them is lying.<p>
    <h3>Q: What are the goals with historical accuracy?</h3>
    <p>Kirke's A: Design wise, I really aim to be more accurate but simplified for ease of redrawing it. The main thing I differ is more modern hair, taking what can best be described as a C-Drama approach. My goal is that you should be able to tell a lot about a character from their wardrobe, be that where they're from, where they've spent time in, their wealth and occupation, et cetera. Writting wise, I keep the dialogue loose and a mix of modern and older things. (I like to think we're translating the dialogue in a way.) I've done a lot of research to make sure there's a high level of accuracy aside from that. It's not perfect as I'm not a historian but I am trying.</p>
    <p>Jojo's A: We are certainly trying to be accurate to a degree especially in regards to setting and the like although when it comes to dialogue it's a mix like Kirke said, essentially a healthy balance.</p>
    <p>Vita’s A: Like Kirke and Jojo said, we aim for a nice blend of historical accuracy with some modern touches here and there. When recommending music, I look for aesthetics and lyrics that can emulate the time period without sounding too out of place.</p>
    <h3>Q: This website is working poorly for me, what can I use to fix it?</h3>
    <p>Kirke's A: This tends to happen if you're using Opera GX. Try using it in a different browser; Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and similar browsers should all work. I personally reccommend Firefox.</p>
    <p>Jojo's A: As someone who uses Opera, I totally get it but Chrome and Firefox totally work!</p>
    <h3>Q: What Programs do y'all use?</h3>
    <p>Kirke's A: I draw in Firealpaca on an HP Laptop. For the first parts I used a HUION 1060PLUS drawing tablet. Since then, however, I've updated to a Huion Inspiroy 2 L.</p>
    <p>Jojo's A: I use Davinchi 17 on a omen gaming pc for editing all my videos alongside Soundtrap for audio editing although i am looking for something new when it comes to the audio software.</p>
    <p>Vita’s A: My bare hands.</p>
