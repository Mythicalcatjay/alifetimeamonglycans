    <p>Gena Gennadyovich Medvedev is a shapeshifter, something manish and wolfish and a little something else. He was a pack animal until being unceremoniously abandoned after a blowout fight with his father and running off into bear territory lead to his brother dying and himself narrowly escaping the same fate but paralyzed. He travelled southbound and internalizes it and agreed to help a village along his path to try to undo his seeming wrongs. However, that comes to an end with Catholicism sweeping the village, Catholicism that shares stories of wolves being demons and putting more of a target on Gena’s back. He spends his time in complete solitude until a certain traveller comes along.</p>
    <p>Personality wise, Gena’s more of a sugar and ice kind of guy to put it nicely. That is to say, someone who has some favorite people to warm up to and gets pretty snarly at everyone else. To put it less nicely, he’s kind of bitch. He’s more emotive with his body language then with his tone and tends to come off pretty blunt or smart-assy. He’s still got quite a bit of good in him, being someone to the core more kindhearted and altruistic. When he cares he usually cares deeply and the same is true for hating. However, his nurturing through both his family and years spent in isolation hasn’t promoted him to display that well.</p>
