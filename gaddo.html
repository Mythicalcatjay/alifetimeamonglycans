    <p>Gaddo D’Andrea is something between an apothecary and a traveling merchant, filling in the niche of a hospital driver or pharmacist. He comes from a good amount of money and is pretty book-smart, but his home is admittedly pretty politically unstable. Due to that, he chose to take his craft northward and bounce around with no apparent goal other than to profit, have some self-discovery, and probably have fun. Needless to say, he’s a bit of a disappointment for doing this instead of settling down. He eventually has a choice encounter with a wolf shapeshifter that permanently alters the course of his life.</p>
    <p>Personality-wise, Gaddo’s the type of guy who totally thinks he is cooler than he really is. He tries to act tough but the level of convincing is variable. He’s not the most empathetic despite being a doctor (or well in line with most doctors if you ask us) and he definitely has a bit of way to go in not being an asshole, but it’s going to take work. </p>
