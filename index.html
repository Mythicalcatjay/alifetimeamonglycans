    <h2>Welcome to ALAL's Official Website!</h2>
    <p>A story surrounding a wolf shapeshifter named Gena who decides to tag along with an experienced supplier for apothecaries named Gaddo, promising to aid in journeys in return for being allowed to tag along the tale covers their trials and tribulations along with their more fond and adventurous experiences on the road as well as the people they meet and perhaps even those they have in their pasts as they deliver to various doctors and patients.</p>
    <p>A Lifetime Among Lycans (or ALAL) is an original Youtube series utilizing both Picture Music Videos (PMVs) and voiceacted animatics to tell a story. We are doing this as a passion project with no expectation to make a profit whilest still paying our voiceactors. We are just two young adults who wanted to get our story out there without any barriers aside from our own capabilities. We want to thank you dearly for visting our website and watching our videos. It means the world us.</p>
