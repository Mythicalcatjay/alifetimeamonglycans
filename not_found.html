    <h2>Page Not Found</h2>
    <p>The page you were looking for doesn't exist! Sorry. Maybe look to see if you made a typo? If you're trying to find something you shouldn't though then I'm laughing at you through my computer screen.</p>
    <p> If you're not sure where you should go next you can click any of the buttons on the top or sidebar. If none of those you should go listen to "Hey Mister Hey" by Poor Man's Posion. It'll pay off I promise.</p>
    <p> You could also listen to my (Kirke's) favorite album. "Ok Computer" by Radiohead. Do it all in one sitting with your headphones on. </p>
    <p> If you don't have either of those then "Slim Shady LP" by Eminem or "Fairytales" by Alexander Rybak. None of these have anything in common but you have probably noticed how broad Jojo and I's music taste by now.</p>
    <p> Maybe you can watch something? If you want a good romance movie maybe check out "The Lost Valentine." It's a hallmark movie which isn't normally my cup of tea but it has Betty White in it and is way better then you'd ever expect to be. My grandparents and I watched it not too long after she passed away since it was free (as the hallmark channel did with both it and all their Golden Girls episodes) and I was blown away.</p>
    <p> Maybe something wolfy instead of romance?? How about Wolf's Rain. I watched it for the first time in subs and then immediately after with my mom in dubs. It's geninuely one of the best shows I've ever watched. Keiko Nobumoto is fantastic as always and the score by Yoko Kanno is always so beautiful. It's also wonderfully done in both ways to listen.</p>
    <p> How about a website! You should absolutely check out homestarrunner.com. It's one of the best places on the internet if you haven't been and if you have been but just haven't been in a while they still update infrequently. It's wonderful since they truly never miss. I hope you giggle and maybe find a 404 page funnier then this one.</p>
    <p> None of those look interesting enough? Alright damn. Here's a link to my cat blog: kittyowner.tumblr.com <p>
    <p> Still here? </p>
    <p> I think you're wasting your time. Go find something better to do then reading fucking 404 pages.</p>
